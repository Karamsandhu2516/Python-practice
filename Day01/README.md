# Day01 — Python Practice

This folder contains Day 01 practice for the Python course.

Files
- `Practice_day01.py` — interactive script that checks CPU, disk and memory usage against provided thresholds.

Screenshot

Below is an example terminal screenshot from running `Practice_day01.py`. The image file should be named `day01_screenshot.png` and placed in this directory so it renders on GitHub.

![Day01 terminal output](./day01_screenshot.png)

How to run locally

```bash
python3.14 Day01/Practice_day01.py
```

Notes
- If the screenshot doesn't display on GitHub, make sure `Day01/day01_screenshot.png` exists and is committed.
- To replace the placeholder screenshot with the real image, copy the PNG into this folder and run:

```bash
git add Day01/day01_screenshot.png
git commit -m "Day01: add real screenshot"
git push
```

If you'd like, I can replace the placeholder with the actual PNG and push for you—upload the image here and say "replace and push".

If you'd like, I can also:

- or create a non-interactive test wrapper for `Practice_day01.py`.
