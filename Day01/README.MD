# Day01 — Python Practice

This folder contains my Day 01 practice for the Python course.

Files
- `Practice_day01.py` — interactive script that checks CPU/Disk/Memory usage thresholds.

Screenshot

Below is the terminal screenshot from running `Practice_day01.py` showing example input and output. Save the provided screenshot file as `day01_screenshot.png` inside this directory (same level as this README) so it renders here on GitHub.

![Day01 terminal output](./day01_screenshot.png)

Notes
- If the screenshot doesn't display on GitHub, make sure the image file exists at `Day01/day01_screenshot.png` and is committed.
- To run locally:

```bash
python3.14 Day01/Practice_day01.py
```

If you'd like, I can also:
- add the screenshot file into the repo (you can upload the image, or I can add it if you provide the image file),
- or create a non-interactive test wrapper for `Practice_day01.py`.
